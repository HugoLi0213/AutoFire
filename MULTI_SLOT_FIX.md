# Multi-Slot Simultaneous Usage - Fix Summary

## Problem
When you had two or more slots configured, only ONE could be used at a time. The currently selected slot would work, but other slots were ignored.

## Root Cause
The `AutoFireEngine` was designed to handle only a single slot:
- Had `self._slot` (singular)
- `apply_slot()` method only accepted one slot
- Keyboard handlers were bound for only one trigger key
- Only one thread was used for the autofire loop

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Engine Architecture Changes**

**Before:**
```python
class AutoFireEngine:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        self._slot = AutoFireSlot()          # Single slot
        self._is_active = False              # Single active state
        self._thread = None                  # Single thread
```

**After:**
```python
class AutoFireEngine:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        self._slots = []                     # Multiple slots
        self._slot_states = {}               # Per-slot active states
        self._slot_threads = {}              # Per-slot threads
```

### 2. **Key Changes Made**

#### a) New `apply_slots()` method
- Accepts a list of enabled slots
- Replaces single-slot `apply_slot()` (kept for backward compatibility)

#### b) Updated `bind_trigger_handlers()`
- Binds keyboard handlers for ALL enabled slots
- Creates closures to capture each slot
- Tracks multiple trigger keys simultaneously

#### c) Per-Slot State Management
- `_slot_states`: Dict mapping trigger_key â†’ is_active
- `_slot_threads`: Dict mapping trigger_key â†’ thread
- Each slot can be independently active/inactive

#### d) Updated `_autofire_loop(slot)`
- Now accepts a slot parameter
- Each slot runs in its own thread
- Multiple loops can run simultaneously

#### e) Enhanced Status Display
- Shows "Running (X slots)" when started
- Shows "Active: Q, E, A" when slots are firing
- Updates dynamically as slots activate/deactivate

### 3. **UI Changes**

#### Updated `start_autofire()`
```python
# OLD: Apply only current slot
slot = config.slots[self.current_slot_index]
self.engine.apply_slot(slot)

# NEW: Apply ALL enabled slots
enabled_slots = [s for s in config.slots if s.enabled]
self.engine.apply_slots(enabled_slots)
```

## How It Works Now

### Example Configuration:
```
Slot 1: âœ“ Q â†’ W @50ms  (Enabled)
Slot 2: âœ“ E â†’ R @50ms  (Enabled)
Slot 3: âœ“ A â†’ S @100ms (Enabled)
Slot 4: âœ— Z â†’ X @75ms  (Disabled)
```

### When You Click START:
1. Engine receives all 3 enabled slots
2. Binds keyboard handlers for Q, E, and A
3. Status shows: "Running (3 slots)"

### When You Hold Keys:
- **Hold Q**: Thread 1 fires W repeatedly at 50ms intervals
- **Hold E**: Thread 2 fires R repeatedly at 50ms intervals
- **Hold A**: Thread 3 fires S repeatedly at 100ms intervals
- **Hold Q+E together**: Both threads fire simultaneously!

### Status Updates:
- Press Q: "Active: Q"
- Press E while holding Q: "Active: Q, E"
- Release Q: "Active: E"
- Release E: "Running (3 slots)"

## Benefits

âœ… **Multiple simultaneous triggers** - All enabled slots work at once
âœ… **Independent intervals** - Each slot can have different timing
âœ… **Independent targeting** - Each slot can target different windows
âœ… **Mix methods** - Some slots can use SendInput, others PostMessage
âœ… **Better status feedback** - See which slots are active in real-time
âœ… **Thread safety** - Each slot has its own thread with proper locking

## Testing

Added comprehensive tests in `test_multi_slot.py`:
- `test_multiple_slots_simultaneously` - Verifies all slots bind correctly
- `test_disabled_slots_not_activated` - Ensures disabled slots are ignored
- All 20+ existing tests still pass with the new architecture

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… Single-slot configurations still work
âœ… Old `apply_slot()` method still available
âœ… Config file format supports both old and new styles
âœ… All existing tests pass without modification

## Usage Example

1. **Add Multiple Slots:**
   - Click "Add Slot" to create Slot 2
   - Configure Q â†’ W
   - Click "Add Slot" to create Slot 3
   - Configure E â†’ R

2. **Enable Both Slots:**
   - Make sure both have âœ“ markers (not âœ—)

3. **Click START:**
   - Status shows "Running (2 slots)"

4. **Test:**
   - Hold Q: Outputs W repeatedly
   - Hold E: Outputs R repeatedly
   - Hold Q+E: Both fire together!

5. **Click STOP:**
   - All slots stop

That's it! All your enabled slots now work simultaneously! ðŸŽ‰

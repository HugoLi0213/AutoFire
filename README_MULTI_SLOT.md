## Technical Details

### Engine Now Supports:
- ✅ Multiple slots active simultaneously
- ✅ Each slot runs in its own thread
- ✅ Independent intervals per slot
- ✅ Different windows per slot (optional)
- ✅ Mix SendInput and PostMessage methods
- ✅ Real-time status showing active slots

### Architecture:
```
OLD (Single Slot):
User presses START → Engine binds 1 trigger → 1 thread runs

NEW (Multi-Slot):
User presses START → Engine binds N triggers → N threads run independently
```

### Status Messages:
- **"Running (3 slots)"** = 3 enabled slots are ready
- **"Active: Q"** = Q is currently being held
- **"Active: Q, E, A"** = Multiple keys being held simultaneously
- **"Stopped"** = All slots stopped

## Example Use Cases

### Gaming:
```
Slot 1: Q → 1 (Ability 1 spam)
Slot 2: E → 2 (Ability 2 spam)
Slot 3: R → 3 (Ability 3 spam)
```
Hold Q for ability 1, hold E for ability 2, or hold both!

```
All shortcuts available simultaneously!

### Testing:
